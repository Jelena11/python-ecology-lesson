    "# The Basics of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a general purpose programming language that supports rapid development\n",
    "of scripts and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's main advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Open Source software, supported by Python Software Foundation\n",
    "* Available on all platforms\n",
    "* \"Batteries Included\" philosophy - libraries for common tasks available in\n",
    "  standard installation\n",
    "* Supports multiple programming paradigms\n",
    "* Very large community\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language. As a consequence, we can use it in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using interpreter as an \"advanced calculator\" in interactive mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "user:host:~$ python\n",

    "## Introduction to Python built-in data types\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strings, integers and floats\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic data types in Python are strings, integers and floats:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "text = \"Data Carpentry\"\n",
    "number = 42\n",
    "pi_value = 3.1415\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we've assigned data to variables, namely `text`, `number` and `pi_value`,\n",
    "using the assignment operator `=`. The variable called `text` is a string which\n",
    "means it can contain letters and numbers. We could reassign the variable `text`\n",
    "to an integer too - but be careful reassigning variables as this can get \n",
    "confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "To print out the value stored in a variable we can simply type the name of the\n",
    "variable into the interpreter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> text\n",
    "\"Data Carpentry\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "however, in scripts we must use the `print` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Comments start with #\n",
    "# Next line will print out text\n",

    "## Sequential types: Lists and Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lists** are a common data structure to hold an ordered sequence of\n",
    "elements. Each element can be accessed by an index:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> numbers = [1,2,3]\n",
    ">>> numbers[0]\n",
    "1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A `for` loop can be used to access the elements in a list or other Python data\n",
    "structure one at a time:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for num in numbers:\n",
    "    print(num)\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Indentation** is very important in Python. Note that the second line in the\n",
    "example above is indented. This is Python's way of marking a block of code. We will\n",
    "discuss this in more detail later.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add elements to the end of a list, we can use the `append` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> numbers.append(4)\n",
    ">>> print(numbers)\n",
    "[1,2,3,4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are a way to interact with an object (a list, for example). We can invoke \n",
    "a method using the dot `.` followed by the method name and a list of arguments in parentheses. \n",
    "To find out what methods are available for an object, we can use the built-in `help` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "help(numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "Help on list object:\n",
    "\n",
    "class list(object)\n",
    " |  list() -> new empty list\n",
    " |  list(iterable) -> new list initialized from iterable's items\n",
    " ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also access a list of methods using `dir`. Some methods names are\n",
    "surrounded by double underscores. Those methods are called \"special\", and\n",
    "usually we access them in a different way. For example `__add__` method is\n",
    "responsible for the `+` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dir(numbers)\n",
    ">>> dir(numbers)\n",
    "['__add__', '__class__', '__contains__', ...]\n",

    "### Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "A tuple is similar to a list in that it's an ordered sequence of elements. However,\n",
    "tuples can not be changed once created (they are \"immutable\"). Tuples are\n",
    "created by placing comma-separated values inside parentheses `()`.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Note: lists use square brackets\n",
    "a_list = [1,2,3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge\n",
    "1. What happens when you type `a_tuple[2]=5` vs `a_list[1]=5` ?\n",
    "2. Type `type(a_tuple)` into python - what is the object type?\n"

    "## Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "A **dictionary** is a container that holds pairs of objects - keys and values.\n",

    ">>> translation = {\"one\" : 1, \"two\" : 2}\n",
    ">>> translation[\"one\"]\n",
    "1\n",

    "Dictionaries work a lot like lists - except that you index them with *keys*. \n",
    "You can think about a key as a name for or a unique identifier for a set of values\n",
    "in the dictionary. Keys can only have particular types - they have to be \n",
    "\"hashable\". Strings and numeric types are acceptable, but lists aren't.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> rev = {1 : \"one\", 2 : \"two\"}\n",
    ">>> rev[1]\n",
    "'one'\n",
    ">>> bad = {[1,2,3] : 3}\n",
    "...\n",
    "TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To add an item to the dictionary we assign a value to a new key:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    ">>> rev[3] = \"three\"\n",
    ">>> rev\n",
    "{1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `for` loops with dictionaries is a little more complicated. We can do this\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> for key, value in rev.items():\n",
    "...     print(key, \"->\", value)\n",
    "...\n",
    "1 -> one\n",
    "2 -> two\n",
    "3 -> three\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> for key in rev.keys():\n",
    "...     print(key, \"->\", rev[key])\n",
    "...\n",
    "1 -> one\n",
    "2 -> two\n",
    "3 -> three\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Challenge\n",
    "Can you do reassignment in a dictionary? Give it a try. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. First check what `rev` is right now (remember `rev` is the name of our dictionary). \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Type:\n",
    "`>>> rev`\n",
    "\n",
    "    You should see the following output:\n",
    "`{1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}`\n",
    "2. Try to reassign the second value (in the *key value pair*) so that it no longer reads \"two\" but instead reads \"apple-sauce\". \n",
    "`>>> rev[2] = \"apple-sauce\"`\n",
    "3. Now display `rev` again to see if it has changed; you should see the following:\n",
    "`{1: 'one', 2: 'apple-sauce', 3: 'three'}`\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that dictionaries are \"unordered\" and do not remember the\n",
    "sequence of their items (i.e. the order in which key:value pairs were added to \n",
    "the dictionary). Because of this, the order in which items are returned from loops\n",
    "over dictionaries might appear random and can even change with time."
